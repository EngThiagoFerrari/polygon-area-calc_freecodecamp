### Message from Thiago Ferrari  
This is my solution for freeCodeCamp.org's Polygon Area Calculator - Scientific Computing with Python Projects


This boilerplate brings all the necessary files for running and testing the program.
The only file I edited was the "shape_calculator.py" where I wrote the python program following the instructions stated on freeCodeCamp.org link mentioned above.  

The file main.py imports the "shape_calculator.py" to be excecuted. It also starts the test_module.py - where I could check whether or not I met all of the project's requirements.
